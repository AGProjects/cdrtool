  * Added MySQL stored procedure for auto-rotation of radacct table using

    tables and the need for optimization of indexes, which can lock database
    tables for writing and cause downtime. Requires modification of sql.conf
    based on setup/radius/OpenSER/radius_accounting.conf, recompilation of

    how to customize the behaviour of the normalization function

    two when both SIP UAs are outside the MediaProxy network
