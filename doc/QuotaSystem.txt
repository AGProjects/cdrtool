The quota system
----------------

The quota system works with OpenSIPS data sources. It enforces maximum
monthly usage limits for post-paid accounts. The system is not stopping in
real-time ongoing calls but provides in practice a protection against
fraudulent usage on a platform basis.

To enable quotas you must:

1. Add the the column quota to the opensips subscriber mysql table:

alter table opensips.subscriber add column quota int unsigned not null;

2. Set the quota for each subscriber to a value, which represents the cost
the subscriber is allowed to spend per calendar month.

3. Configure OpenSIPS to deny sessions initiated by subscribers belonging to
the quota group:

The quota system then builds incremental statistics, and stores them in
cdrtool.quota_usage mysql table, with usage information from the normalized
SIP sessions. It then compares the curent usage with the assigned monthly
quota and blocks the subscribers when their quota is exceeded by adding them
to the group 'quota'.

The quota is checked by the cron job:

/var/www/CDRTool/scripts/OpenSIPS/quotaCheck.php

At the beginning of each calendar month the quota usage is reset and all
users are unblocked:

/var/www/CDRTool/scripts/OpenSIPS/quotaReset.php

The current quota usage can be monitored in Rating -> Quota usage web page.

When quota is exceeded, an email notification is sent to the user and a copy
of the message to the platform administrator. To customize the email message
subject, body and other header fields you must create some entries in
cdrtool.settings table. See CDRTool/setup/mysql/custom_notifications.mysql
for an example.
