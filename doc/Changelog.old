3.2
Rating engine
-------------
The rating engine has been separated from CDRTool web pages.
- On the fly rating can be set to obtain rating information from the network
  rating engine. This is faster then loading mysql tables at each web page
  reload. To enable network rating set "EnableNetworkRating"=> "1" in
  global.inc for each datasource. If network rating is not available, 
  the rating will fall back to the old method (load tables in memory)
- Lock database only if there are un-normalized calls
- Added control to reload rating engine tables and display engine status
- Added new operations for the web management of rating tables
   - Allow deletion of selections
   - Rates can be copied under a new name
   - Require confirmation when deleting/copying
- Added alternatives profiles for customers. This way one can setup rates
  based on exceptions. For example a customer may have a dedicated rate
  table where only a few destinations have different price, the rest of the
  destinations are charged from a default profile
  billing_customers table has changed (see alter_tables.mysql)
- The customers.csv file may contain another 2 columns for alternative
  rating profiles 
- Apply rating only for calls with duration > 0

Normalization process
---------------------
- Normalize also SipRPIDHeader
- Allow selection of un-normalized calls (SER data-source)
- Cisco datasource treats H323RemoteAddress as $this->gateway 
  For ISDN trunks remote gateway is identified by CiscoIP-ISDN-X
  where X is the E1 number. This combined key can have dedicated rates 
  in Rating tables.

Prepaid engine
--------------
