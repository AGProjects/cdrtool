Exporting CDRs from CDRTool
---------------------------

You can export the data in two ways. 

1. Select in the web Export to csv after the query in the results page

2. It is safe to do a query on the MySQL radius.radacct table where Normalized
= '1' and apply other filter criteria like date and time restrictions. The
Normalized field set to 1 means that the call has ended, is rated and no
other applications changes it.

It is however possible to manually reNormalize the calls in case for example
you changed some rating information and you want to apply the changes to
previously normalized calls. To avoid this unlikely situation you can put a
lock on the table cdrtool.normalize_lock. This table is locked during each
normalization process so that is not possible by two parallel processes to
change the data.

So in your export program you can do something similar to this pseudo code:

$locker = new CDRTool_DB;
// lock the database
$locker->query("lock tables normalize_lock write");
// select records
$locker->query("select * from radacct where Normalized ='1' and time >
'lastmonth'");
// read records
$locker->read_records();
// done remove the lock
$locker->query("unlock tables");
