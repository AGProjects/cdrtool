Description
------------

CDRTool is a support system for VoIP service providers. CDRTool allows
real-time mediation, rating, prepaid and web access to Call Detail Records
generated by SIP Proxies, VoIP gateways or other network access
equipment using RADIUS protocol.

CDRTool is a simple to use WEB application, which can be put in service with
minimal training of the helpdesk and operations staff. It gives you or your
customers instant access to SIP usage information, traces from CDR level to
protocol level, statistics grouped by criteria like release cause,
destination or billing parties and can help pin-point SIP/ISDN call flows
failure reason. Using CDRTool you can lower your customer support response
time for SIP related problems to almost zero.

Having access to service usage information extracted from both signaling
and media paths, CDRTool may be used to build various billing models based
on any combination of bandwidth, destination, application type and duration.

CDRTool provides 100% accurate accounting for call detail records generated
by SIP Express Router used in combination with MediaProxy far-end NAT
traversal solution regardless of the presence of BYE messages.

CDRTool provides an anti-fraud mechanism for blocking accounts in SIP
Express Router that exceed predefined user quota.

CDRTool makes rating functions available via the network so that you can use
CDRTool rating engine for postpaid application or in combination with
third-party B2BUAs for prepaid applications. The functions are available via
TCP/IP network socket or as SOAP/XML webservice. A Call control module in
OpenSER can perform the prepaid function based on money credit and rating per
destination.

Target market
-------------

CDRTool is a mature product with several years in production with telecom
companies and pan-European carriers and has been used in environments with
millions of CDRs per month.

The main focus of CDRTool is to provide a carrier grade mediation and rating
engine for service providers deploying SIP Express Router as SIP Proxy /
Registrar in combination with Cisco or Asterisk gateways. 

Disclaimer
----------

The information provided by CDRTool documentation is not always enough to
successfully complete the installation and deployment of CDRTool. Most of
the configuration tasks are related to setting up components outside CDRTool
environment. Configuration of components like MySQL server, FreeRadius
server, Cisco gateways, MediaProxy or SIP Express Router require a project
management approach in place of a step by step installation procedure.

Features
--------

CDRTool allows real-time web access to Call Details Records like the Radius
tickets generated by SIP Express Router. The information can be combined
with media information from MediaProxy while a separate OpenSER module can
display full traces of all SIP packets the enter and exit the SIP Proxy.
CDRs can be filtered and statistics can be built in real-time to summarize
service usage based on various criteria.

Several users can share the search criteria and the query results. Ticket
numbers can be linked to sets of Call Details Records. Queries and results
can be replayed later to reproduce an exiting or a previous problem. This
feature allows fast communication and troubleshooting when multiple
departments work together to find a resolution for a problem and communicate
it with the customer.
