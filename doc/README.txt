CDRTool provides a CDR mediation and rating engine for Call Details Records
generated by OpenSIPS SIP Proxy/Registrar/Presence server.

CDRTool is a simple to use WEB application, which can be put in service with
minimal training of the helpdesk and operations staff. It provides instant
access to SIP usage information, traces from CDR level to protocol level,
statistics grouped by criteria like release cause, destination or billing
parties and can help pin-point SIP call flows failure reason.

CDRTool provides accurate accounting for call detail records generated by
OpenSIPS when used in combination with MediaProxy regardless of the
availability of BYE messages.

CDRTool provides an anti-fraud mechanism for blocking SIP accounts that
exceed predefined user quota.

CDRTool makes rating functions available via the network so that you can use
CDRTool rating engine for postpaid application or in combination with
third-party B2BUAs for prepaid applications. The functions are available via
a TCP/IP network socket. Call Control prepaid application can be used
together with OpenSIPS and CDRTool to provide session control for prepaid
services.


Target market
-------------

CDRTool is a mature product with several years in production and has been
used in environments with up to tens of millions of CDRs per month.

The main goal of CDRTool is to provide a carrier grade mediation and rating
engine for service providers deploying OpenSIPS as SIP Proxy/Registrar.


Disclaimer
----------

The information provided by CDRTool documentation is not always enough to
successfully complete the installation and deployment of CDRTool. Most of
the configuration tasks are related to setting up components outside CDRTool
environment. 

Good knowledge in the configuration of MySQL, FreeRadius, MediaProxy and
OpenSIPS are required to successfully complete a CDRTool installation.


Features
--------

CDRTool allows real-time web access to Call Details Records generated by
OpenSIPS radius accounting and sip trace modules. The information can be
combined with media information logged by MediaProxy while a separate
OpenSIPS module can display complete messages of all SIP messages the enter
and exit the SIP Proxy. CDRs can be filtered and statistics can be built in
real-time to summarize service usage based on various criteria.

Multiple users can share the CDR search criteria and the query results.
Ticket numbers can be linked to sets of Call Details Records. Queries and
results can be replayed later to reproduce an exiting or a previous problem.
This feature allows fast communication and troubleshooting when multiple
departments work together to find a resolution for a problem and communicate
it with the customer.
