CDRTool provides mediation, accounting and tracing for Call Detail Records
generated by OpenSER by using RADIUS protocol and OpenSER siptrace facility.

CDRTool is a simple to use WEB application, which can be put in service with
minimal training of the helpdesk and operations staff. It gives you or your
customers instant access to SIP usage information, traces from CDR level to
protocol level, statistics grouped by criteria like release cause,
destination or billing parties and can help pin-point SIP/ISDN call flows
and failure reason.

CDRTool provides 100% accurate accounting for call detail records generated
by OpenSER used in combination with MediaProxy regardless of the
availability of BYE messages.

CDRTool provides an anti-fraud mechanism for blocking SIP accounts that
exceed predefined user quota.

CDRTool makes rating functions available via the network so that you can use
CDRTool rating engine for postpaid application or in combination with
third-party B2BUAs for prepaid applications. The functions are available via
TCP/IP network socket. 


Target market
-------------

CDRTool is a mature product with several years in production and has been
used in environments with up to tens of millions of CDRs per month.

The main focus of CDRTool is to provide a carrier grade mediation and rating
engine for service providers deploying OpenSER as SIP Proxy / Registrar in
combination with Cisco or Asterisk gateways.


Disclaimer
----------

The information provided by CDRTool documentation is not always enough to
successfully complete the installation and deployment of CDRTool. Most of
the configuration tasks are related to setting up components outside CDRTool
environment. Knowledge in the configuration of components like MySQL server,
FreeRadius server, Cisco gateways, MediaProxy and OpenSER is required to
successfully complete a CDRTool installation.


Features
--------

CDRTool allows real-time web access to Call Details Records like the Radius
tickets generated by OpenSER radius accounting module. The information can
be combined with media information from MediaProxy while a separate OpenSER
module can display full traces of all SIP packets the enter and exit the SIP
Proxy. CDRs can be filtered and statistics can be built in real-time to
summarize service usage based on various criteria.

Several CDRTool users can share the search criteria and the query results.
Ticket numbers can be linked to sets of Call Details Records. Queries and
results can be replayed later to reproduce an exiting or a previous problem.
This feature allows fast communication and troubleshooting when multiple
departments work together to find a resolution for a problem and communicate
it with the customer.
