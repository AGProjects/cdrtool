#
#  	Also general configuration for modules can be done

#
#	The configuration variables defined here are of the form ${foo}
#	They are local to this file, and do not change from request to

#
#	The per-request variables are of the form %{Attribute-Name}, and

#
# libdir: Where to find the rlm_* modules.
#
#   This should be automatically set at configuration time.
#
#   If the server builds and installs, but fails at execution time
#   with an 'undefined symbol' error, then you can use the libdir
#   directive to work around the problem.
#
#   The cause is usually that a library has been installed on your
#   system in a place where the dynamic linker CANNOT find it.  When
#   executing as root (or another user), your personal environment MAY
#   be set up to allow the dynamic linker to find the library.  When
#   executing as a daemon, FreeRADIUS MAY NOT have the same
#   personalized configuration.
#
#   To work around the problem, find out which library contains that symbol,
#   and add the directory containing that library to the end of 'libdir',
#   with a colon separating the directory names.  NO spaces are allowed.
#
#   e.g. libdir = /usr/local/lib:/opt/package/lib
#
#   You can also try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
#   in a script which starts the server.
#
#   If that does not work, then you can re-configure and re-build the
#   server to NOT use shared libraries, via:
#
#	./configure --disable-shared
#	make
#	make install
#
libdir = ${exec_prefix}/lib

#  pidfile: Where to place the PID of the RADIUS server.
#
#  The server may be signalled while it's running by using this
#  file.
#
#  This file is written when ONLY running in daemon mode.
#
#  e.g.:  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/radiusd/radiusd.pid`
#
pidfile = ${run_dir}/radiusd.pid


# user/group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run radiusd as.
#
#   If these are commented out, the server will run as the user/group
#   that started it.  In order to change to a different user/group, you
#   MUST be root ( or have root privleges ) to start the server.
#
#   We STRONGLY recommend that you run the server with as few permissions
#   as possible.  That is, if you're not using shadow passwords, the
#   user and group items below should be set to 'nobody'.
#
#    On SCO (ODT 3) use "user = nouser" and "group = nogroup".
#
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(group) when the value of
#  (unsigned)group is above 60000; don't use group nobody on these systems!
#
#  On systems with shadow passwords, you might have to set 'group = shadow'
#  for the server to be able to read the shadow password file.  If you can
#  authenticate users while in debug mode, but not in daemon mode, it may be
#  that the debugging mode server is running as a user that can read the
#  shadow info, and the user listed below can not.
#
#user = nobody
#group = nobody

#  max_request_time: The maximum time (in seconds) to handle a request.
#
#  Requests which take more time than this to process may be killed, and
#  a REJECT message is returned.
#
#  WARNING: If you notice that requests take a long time to be handled,
#  then this MAY INDICATE a bug in the server, in one of the modules
#  used to handle a request, OR in your local configuration.
#
#  This problem is most often seen when using an SQL database.  If it takes
#  more than a second or two to receive an answer from the SQL database,
#  then it probably means that you haven't indexed the database.  See your
#  SQL server documentation for more information.
#
#  Useful range of values: 5 to 120
#
max_request_time = 30

#  delete_blocked_requests: If the request takes MORE THAN 'max_request_time'
#  to be handled, then maybe the server should delete it.
#
#  If you're running in threaded, or thread pool mode, this setting
#  should probably be 'no'.  Setting it to 'yes' when using a threaded
#  server MAY cause the server to crash!
#
delete_blocked_requests = no

#  cleanup_delay: The time to wait (in seconds) before cleaning up
#  a reply which was sent to the NAS.
#
#  The RADIUS request is normally cached internally for a short period
#  of time, after the reply is sent to the NAS.  The reply packet may be
#  lost in the network, and the NAS will not see it.  The NAS will then
#  re-send the request, and the server will respond quickly with the
#  cached reply.
#
#  If this value is set too low, then duplicate requests from the NAS
#  MAY NOT be detected, and will instead be handled as seperate requests.
#
#  If this value is set too high, then the server will cache too many
#  requests, and some new requests may get blocked.  (See 'max_requests'.)
#
#  Useful range of values: 2 to 10
#
cleanup_delay = 5

#  max_requests: The maximum number of requests which the server keeps
#  track of.  This should be 256 multiplied by the number of clients.
#  e.g. With 4 clients, this number should be 1024.
#
#  If this number is too low, then when the server becomes busy,
#  it will not respond to any new requests, until the 'cleanup_delay'
#  time has passed, and it has removed the old requests.
#
#  If this number is set too high, then the server will use a bit more
#  memory for no real benefit.
#
#  If you aren't sure what it should be set to, it's better to set it
#  too high than too low.  Setting it to 1000 per client is probably
#  the highest it should be.
#
#  Useful range of values: 256 to infinity
#
max_requests = 1024

#  bind_address:  Make the server listen on a particular IP address, and
#  send replies out from that address.  This directive is most useful
#  for machines with multiple IP addresses on one interface.
#
#  It can either contain "*", or an IP address, or a fully qualified
#  Internet domain name.  The default is "*"
#
bind_address = *

#  port: Allows you to bind FreeRADIUS to a specific port.
#
#  The default port that most NAS boxes use is 1645, which is historical.
#  RFC 2138 defines 1812 to be the new port.  Many new servers and
#  NAS boxes use 1812, which can create interoperability problems.
#
#  The port is defined here to be 0 so that the server will pick up
#  the machine's local configuration for the radius port, as defined
#  in /etc/services.
#
#  If you want to use the default RADIUS port as defined on your server,
#  (usually through 'grep radius /etc/services') set this to 0 (zero).
#
#  A port given on the command-line via '-p' over-rides this one.
#
port = 0

#  hostname_lookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
#  e.g., www.freeradius.org (on) or 206.47.27.232 (off).
#
#  The default is 'off' because it would be overall better for the net
#  if people had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it
#  means that each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup
#  request to the nameserver.   Enabling hostname_lookups will also
#  mean that your server may stop randomly for 30 seconds from time
#  to time, if the DNS requests take too long.
#
#  Turning hostname lookups off also means that the server won't block
#  for 30 seconds, if it sees an IP address which has no name associated
#  with it.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
hostname_lookups = no

#  Core dumps are a bad thing.  This should only be set to 'yes'
#  if you're debugging a problem with the server.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
allow_core_dumps = no

#  Regular expressions
#
#  These items are set at configure time.  If they're set to "yes",
#  then setting them to "no" turns off regular expression support.
#
#  If they're set to "no" at configure time, then setting them to "yes"
#  WILL NOT WORK.  It will give you an error.
#
regular_expressions	= yes
extended_expressions	= yes

#  Log the full User-Name attribute, as it was found in the request.
#
# allowed values: {no, yes}
#
log_stripped_names = no

#  Log authentication requests to the log file.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
log_auth = no

#  Log passwords with the authentication requests.
#  log_auth_badpass  - logs password if it's rejected
#  log_auth_goodpass - logs password if it's correct
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
log_auth_badpass = no
log_auth_goodpass = no

# usercollide:  Turn "username collision" code on and off.  See the
# "doc/duplicate-users" file
#
usercollide = no

# lower_user / lower_pass:  
# Lower case the username/password "before" or "after"
# attempting to authenticate.  
#
#  If "before", the server will first modify the request and then try
#  to auth the user.  If "after", the server will first auth using the
#  values provided by the user.  If that fails it will reprocess the
#  request after modifying it as you specify below.
#
#  This is as close as we can get to case insensitivity.  It is the
#  admin's job to ensure that the username on the auth db side is
#  *also* lowercase to make this work
#
# Default is 'no' (don't lowercase values)
# Valid values = "before" / "after" / "no"
#
lower_user = no
lower_pass = no

# nospace_user / nospace_pass:
#
#  Some users like to enter spaces in their username or password
#  incorrectly.  To save yourself the tech support call, you can
#  eliminate those spaces here:
#
# Default is 'no' (don't remove spaces)
# Valid values = "before" / "after" / "no" (explanation above)
#
nospace_user = no
nospace_pass = no

# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
#
#  There may be multiple methods of attacking on the server.  This
#  section holds the configuration items which minimize the impact
#  of those attacks
#
security {
	#
	#  max_attributes: The maximum number of attributes
	#  permitted in a RADIUS packet.  Packets which have MORE
	#  than this number of attributes in them will be dropped.
	#
	#  If this number is set too low, then no RADIUS packets
	#  will be accepted.
	#
	#  If this number is set too high, then an attacker may be
	#  able to send a small number of packets which will cause
	#  the server to use all available memory on the machine.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "allow any number of attributes"
	max_attributes = 200

	#
	#  delayed_reject: When sending an Access-Reject, it can be
	#  delayed for a few seconds.  This may help slow down a DoS
	#  attack.  It also helps to slow down people trying to brute-force
	#  crack a users password.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "send rejects immediately"
	#
	#  If this number is set higher than 'cleanup_delay', then the
	#  rejects will be sent at 'cleanup_delay' time, when the request
	#  is deleted from the internal cache of requests.
	#
	#  Useful ranges: 1 to 5
	reject_delay = 1

	#
	#  status_server: Whether or not the server will respond
	#  to Status-Server requests.
	#
	#  Normally this should be set to "no", because they're useless.
	#  See: http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2865.html#Keep-Alives
	#
	#  However, certain NAS boxes may require them.	
	#
	#  When sent a Status-Server message, the server responds with
	#  and Access-Accept packet, containing a Reply-Message attribute,
	#  which is a string describing how long the server has been
	#  running.
	#
	status_server = no
}

# PROXY CONFIGURATION
#
#  proxy_requests: Turns proxying of RADIUS requests on or off.
#
#  The server has proxying turned on by default.  If your system is NOT
#  set up to proxy requests to another server, then you can turn proxying
#  off here.  This will save a small amount of resources on the server.
#
#  If you have proxying turned off, and your configuration files say
#  to proxy a request, then an error message will be logged.
#
#  To disable proxying, change the "yes" to "no", and comment the
#  $INCLUDE line.
#
#  allowed values: {no, yes}
#
proxy_requests  = yes
$INCLUDE  ${confdir}/proxy.conf


# CLIENTS CONFIGURATION
#
#  Client configuration is defined in "clients.conf".  
#

#  The 'clients.conf' file contains all of the information from the old
#  'clients' and 'naslist' configuration files.  We recommend that you
#  do NOT use 'client's or 'naslist', although they are still
#  supported.
#
#  Anything listed in 'clients.conf' will take precedence over the
#  information from the old-style configuration files.
#
$INCLUDE  ${confdir}/clients.conf


# SNMP CONFIGURATION
#
#  Snmp configuration is only valid if you enabled SNMP support when
#  you compiled radiusd.
#
$INCLUDE  ${confdir}/snmp.conf


# THREAD POOL CONFIGURATION
#
#  The thread pool is a long-lived group of threads which
#  take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.
#
#  You probably want to have a few spare threads around,
#  so that high-load situations can be handled immediately.  If you
#  don't have any spare threads, then the request handling will
#  be delayed while a new thread is created, and added to the pool.
#
#  You probably don't want too many spare threads around,
#  otherwise they'll be sitting there taking up resources, and
#  not doing anything productive.
#
#  The numbers given below should be adequate for most situations.
#
thread pool {
	#  Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable
	#  ballpark figure.
	start_servers = 5

	#  Limit on the total number of servers running.
	#
	#  If this limit is ever reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it
	#  should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.  It is intended mainly as a brake to
	#  keep a runaway server from taking the system with it as it spirals
	#  down...
	#
	#  You may find that the server is regularly reaching the
	#  'max_servers' number of threads, and that increasing
	#  'max_servers' doesn't seem to make much difference.
	#
	#  If this is the case, then the problem is MOST LIKELY that
	#  your back-end databases are taking too long to respond, and
	#  are preventing the server from responding in a timely manner.
	#
	#  The solution is NOT do keep increasing the 'max_servers'
	#  value, but instead to fix the underlying cause of the
	#  problem: slow database, or 'hostname_lookups=yes'.
	#
	#  For more information, see 'max_request_time', above.
	#
	max_servers = 32

	#  Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess
	#  how many servers you need, FreeRADIUS dynamically adapts to
	#  the load it sees, that is, it tries to maintain enough
	#  servers to handle the current load, plus a few spare
	#  servers to handle transient load spikes.
	#
	#  It does this by periodically checking how many servers are
	#  waiting for a request.  If there are fewer than
	#  min_spare_servers, it creates a new spare.  If there are
	#  more than max_spare_servers, some of the spares die off.
	#  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
	#
	min_spare_servers = 3
	max_spare_servers = 10

	#  There may be memory leaks or resource allocation problems with
	#  the server.  If so, set this value to 300 or so, so that the
	#  resources will be cleaned up periodically.
	#
	#  This should only be necessary if there are serious bugs in the
	#  server which have not yet been fixed.
	#
	#  '0' is a special value meaning 'infinity', or 'the servers never
	#  exit'
	max_requests_per_server = 0

	#  This module takes an attribute (count-attribute).

	#  on the attribute type.
	#  If the attribute is Acct-Session-Time or an integer we add the
	#  value of the attribute. If it is anything else we increase the
	#  counter by one.
	#
	#  The 'reset' parameter defines when the counters are all reset to
	#  zero.  It can be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or never.
	#  It can also be user defined. It should be of the form:
	#  num[hdwm] where:
	#  h: hours, d: days, w: weeks, m: months

	#
	#  DEFAULT Max-Daily-Session := 36000
	#          Fall-Through = 1
	#
	#  You should add the counter module in the instantiate
	#  section so that it registers check-name before the files
	#  module reads the users file.
	#
	#  If check-name is set and the user is to be rejected then we
	#  send back a Reply-Message and we log a Failure-Message in
	#  the radius.log
	#
	#  The counter-name can also be used like below:
	#
	#  DEFAULT  Daily-Session-Time > 3600, Auth-Type = Reject
	#      Reply-Message = "You've used up more than one hour today"
	#
	#  The allowed-servicetype attribute can be used to only take
	#  into account specific sessions. For example if a user first
	#  logs in through a login menu and then selects ppp there will
	#  be two sessions. One for Login-User and one for Framed-User
	#  service type. We only need to take into account the second one.
	#

#

#  authorize refers to a module, it's automatically loaded and
#  initialized.  However, some modules may not be listed in any
#  of the following sections, so they can be listed here.
#
#  Also, listing modules here ensures that you have control over
#  the order in which they are initalized.  If one module needs
#  something defined by another module, you can list them in order
#  here, and ensure that the configuration will be OK.

# Authentication.
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that you have to have a module from the 'authorize' section add
#  a configuration attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type
#  is then used to pick the apropriate module from the list below.
#
#  The default Auth-Type is Local.  That is, whatever is not included inside
# an authtype section will be called only if Auth-Type is set to Local.
#
# So you should do the following:
# - Set Auth-Type to an appropriate value in the authorize modules above.
#   For example, the chap module will set Auth-Type to CHAP, ldap to LDAP, etc.
# - After that create corresponding authtype sections in the
#   authenticate section below and call the appropriate modules.
