Translated Message Catalog Files
================================

Notes
-----
1. Uses iso8859-2 character set. (or at least it should)

If you want to translate CDRTool messages to some other language:
1 - type make cdrtool.pot 
2 - translate cdrtool.pot like:

msgid "$var aborted.\n"
msgstr "$var abortado.\n"

where msgid is the original message and msgstr is the translated
message. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE msgid LINES.

The info pages for gettext has more detailed information on how to do
translations.

Then rename the cdrtool.pot file to the language code with a .po extension,
reconfigure cdrtool and run make install.

To update an already translated message file use the msgmerge command. As
in:

msgmerge ro.po cdrtool.pot > ronew.po
msgmerge nl.po cdrtool.pot > nlnew.po
msgmerge es.po cdrtool.pot > esnew.po

Or just run po/merge.sh script that does it all.

If you use an older version of gettext, the command is tupdate, instead of
msgmerge.

Notes: 

- if you think a message is too obscure just ask about it
- you don't need to translate every single word. Some words/expressions are
  easier to understand in the original English form than in our 
  native languages. 
- you can use characters other than standard ASCII, if needed.
- if you update a translation of someone else, please contact the current
  maintainer, so that we don't have duplicate work. Also put a "history"
